# Scientific Computing with Python

Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, I learned Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions, and had teh opportunity to put them into practise.

In above directories you can see all projects created in this course.
