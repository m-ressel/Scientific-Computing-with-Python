# üêç [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) 

Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, I learned Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions, and had the opportunity to put them into practise.

In above directories you can see all projects created in this course:

* **[‚ûó Arithmetic Formatter](https://github.com/m-ressel/Scientific-Computing-with-Python/tree/main/Arithmetic%20Formatter)** - a function that receives a list of strings of arithmetic problems and returns them arranged vertically and side-by-side
* **[Time Calculator](https://github.com/m-ressel/Scientific-Computing-with-Python/tree/main/Time%20Calculator)** - a function that adds a duration to a starting time and returns the resulting time in a specific format, and can also calculate the day of the week after a certain number of days have passed.
* **[üí∏ Budget App](https://github.com/m-ressel/Scientific-Computing-with-Python/tree/main/Budget%20App)** - a class object that allows users to create, manage, and analyze their budget by performing operations such as deposit, withdraw, transfer, balance, and generate a spending report.
* **[üî≤ Polygon Area Calculator](https://github.com/m-ressel/Scientific-Computing-with-Python/tree/main/Polygon%20Area%20Calculator)** - a type class object that can calculate the area of and print a regular polygon with a given number of sides and a specified side length, can compare the area of two polygons, aand do all those operations for squares.
* **[ü§π Probability Calculator](https://github.com/m-ressel/Scientific-Computing-with-Python/tree/main/Probability%20Calculator)** - a class and function  that simulates a series of experiments based on user-defined conditions to calculate probabilities and returns probability of drawing certain balls from a hat in a series of experiments.
